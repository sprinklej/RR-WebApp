        i  n
        | -of-a-kind, i.e. 5â™¥ï¸Ž, 5â™¦ï¸Ž, 5â™ ï¸Ž - is a set of 3
      li 
        b Run:
        |  Cards of the same suit in ascending/descending order, i.e. 4â™¥ï¸Ž, 5â™¥ï¸Ž, 6â™¥ï¸Ž, 7â™¥ï¸Ž - is a run of 4
      li 
        b Combinations:
        |  Refer to the set(s)/run(s) that need to be accomplished in order to complete the game. There are 
        a(href="#combinations") 8 combinations 
        | that must be completed in sequential order, as well a player can only accomplish 1 combination per round
    h4 Setup
    ul
      li The game is played with 2 decks of cards, including the Jokers
      li The game is best played with 4 players, however it can be played with 2-6 players
      li If you want to play with more than 6 players try adding a third deck of cards
      li Each player is dealt 13 cards, the remaining cards are placed faced down in the center, this is the pickup pile
      li The top card in the pickup pile is turned over and placed in the discard pile
    h4 Starting The Game
    ul
      li Turns are taken in a clockwise fashion, starting with the person to the left of the dealer
      li At the start of a players turn the player must draw a single card, the top card from the pickup or discard pile may be picked up
      li The player attempts to lay down the current combination they are working on. The whole combination must be laid at the same time, i.e. if the player is trying to lay down the combination "Two sets of 3" the player must lay down both sets at the same time
      li Once player has already laid down their own combination, they can add cards to other combinations that have been played by other players
      li At the end of a players turn, the player must put a card into the discard pile (face up)
      li If the card that was just discarded could of been added to other combinations that have been laid down and somebody notices before the next person starts their turn and yells out: rummy, or Google, or pizza, or what ever you decide on, the person that discarded the card must take one card (that they do not choose) from all of the other players
      li The current round ends when a player discards a card and has no other cards in their hand, if a player has played all of their cards and has no card to discard the round is not over and it is the next persons turn
      li At the end of a round each player adds up the 
        a(href="#scoring") value 
        |  of the cards that they still currently hold in their hand, this value is added to their total score
      li For the next round the person to the left of the dealer is now the dealer
      li If any players did not lay down their current combination in the previous round then they do not advance to the next combination and try and accomplish the same combination again
      li Once the 8th combination has been played, the game is over

    h4 Notes
    ul
      li Aces are high
      li 2's and Jokers are wild
      li When a set or run is laid down no more than 50% of the cards can be wild cards, i.e. 5â™ ï¸Ž, Joker, Joker is not valid
      li During a single round sets cannot be repeated, i.e. if a player has laid down the set 5â™£ï¸Ž, 5â™£ï¸Ž, 5â™£ï¸Ž, another player cannot play that set until the next round
      li If the pickup pile is depleted during a round the discard pile is shuffled and then becomes a new pickup pile
