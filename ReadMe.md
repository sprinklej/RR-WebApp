# RR-ScoreKeeper

RR-ScoreKeeper (Riondel Rummy Score Keeper) is a basic web app that lets users keep track of their score as well what cards they are currently trying to lay down. This app was created because keeping track of these multiple items for multiple people on paper can get messy.  

## Installation

1. Navigate to project directory
2. run: `npm install` to download the node modules the project depends on
3. To start the server run: `npm start`
  * OR for debug mode
  * Mac/Linux `DEBUG=rr:* npm start`
  * Windows `set DEBUG=* & npm start` <- I haven't tried this but I believe it is right

The server currently listens on port 3001, (this can be changed in the bin/www file) so navigate to http://localhost:3001 to view the page.
